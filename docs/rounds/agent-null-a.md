# agent/null-a

The Null worker's report, kept current with each commit. Working in Null's main checkout on `main` (Sau's decision S58). Tasks from Sau's board: 1a-01, 1a-04, then 1a-02 and 1a-03.

## 1a-01: share Scowr's front end by path

Done, November 7, 2026.

**What works.** Null's workspace depends on Scowr's `scowr_syntax` and `scowr_errors` by path (`../Scowr/compiler/…`, root `Cargo.toml`, `[workspace.dependencies]`). A new crate, `compiler/null_syntax`, is the only Null crate that names them: it re-exports the lossless tree, the typed view and the diagnostics types, and maps syntax diagnostics to Null's code `null-syntax`. The boundary (what is shared, what is Null's, how a change to Scowr is made) is in `AGENTS.md`, "The shared front end". No change to Scowr was needed.

**Measured.**

- `cargo test -p null_syntax`: 5 tests and 1 doctest pass. They check that all five `null` examples of the spec (section 4, read from `docs/spec/null-v0.md` at build time, so they stay checked) parse with no diagnostics and print back byte for byte; the tree of the pier example; that unit, colour, link, path and package words stay whole; that a broken line gives `null-syntax` diagnostics and the rest of the file still parses; and that Scowr's keyword attributes reach Null as keywords.
- Null's `just check` exits 0.
- Scowr's own tests at Scowr `4de7474`, run unchanged with the build guard as `RUSTC_WRAPPER` and a target folder outside Scowr: 192 passed, 0 failed, 49 suites. Scowr's `git status` is clean before and after.

**Found.**

- `cargo fmt --all` formats local path dependencies too: run in Null it listed every file of Scowr's workspace. Null's `just check` and `just fmt` now run `cargo fmt` (workspace members only). Cosmósis's justfile still runs `cargo fmt --all`; once Cosmósis depends on Null by path, `just fmt` there would rewrite Null's and Scowr's files. For the lead: Cosmósis needs the same change.
- The spec's example `modifier @bevel bevel { width 4mm segments 3 }` is one child node, `width`, with three arguments, since a node ends only at a line feed, `;` or `}`. The intended form is `{ width 4mm; segments 3 }` or `width=4mm segments=3` on the modifier's line. Left for the spec's owner and the checker (1a-06); the test records the current reading.
- Scowr reads `at`, `to` and `len` before a value as keyword attributes; Null's checker must treat them (noted in `AGENTS.md`).

**Unverified.** Nothing in 1a-01's "Done when" is unverified. `just verify` runs no fuzz target yet (1a-03 brings the first).
